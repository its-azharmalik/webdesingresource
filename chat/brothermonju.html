@Khaled vai, Can you please come to my desk? I'll give an short overview about CherryLED UI component


Q: Where are we at with the htmls?
A:Component set done except custom select/multiselect element. It should be designed after

Q:library integration by Developer
A:why components are taking so much time? is it very complex? by three weeks we are  yet to finish the components


We did not work with Component UI for three weeks. so weeks  count is useless for us, by the way, Around 4-5 days are required for a full component set design.
In that case we just worked for 3 full days with UI, thats why being delayed.
Anyway trying hard to finish asap.
