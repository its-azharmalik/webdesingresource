Hello Sir,

Kindly please note the following:
On 01.01.2018, Monday - I was late in arriving at the office. At the same time, I missed out on giving my fingerprint on my way out.

On 14.01.2018 and 15.01.2018 as well - I was late in arriving at the office due to lack of transport on the occasion of Bishwa Iztema

As a result, I'd like to make a sincere request to you for not considering this as a late attendance. At the same time, I would also like to assure you that I will never forget to mark my attendance in the near future following these instances mentioned above.

Thank you for your time looking into this matter.
Appreciate your cooperation.

Dear All,

In many cases, you can save huge medical costs by following a few simple steps. When you get hospitalized,

1.      Please SMS/call 01713043043 (you can find the number in back side of Medical ID card)  and advise your ID No & MetLife People will ask Hospital Name. (Tips: It is a good idea to keep photos of both sides of the insurance card in your mobile phone).

2.      If Nominated Hospital (attached) then MetLife will follow up with Hospital.
3.      If not Nominated or forgot to inform MetLife then please keep all the records including bills with you & we will submit to MetLife for payment.
4.      If the Employee hospitalized out of country then please keep all the records specially bills and payment receipts original copy.
5.   If you feel lack of support from call centre, feel free to call me or Matiur.


The insurance will cover:
1.	Maximum 75K BDT in total
2.	For Room/Board in total - maximum 30K
3.	For Room/Board per day - maximum 1050 BDT
4.	ICU - maximum 14 days
5.	Surgery, Medicine, Doctor visit - maximum 45K BDT

We quarterly pay a lot of money to the insurance company. So, it is very important for us that you get the rightful benefit when needed.

If you have any questions, feel free to ask me separately.

Thank You
